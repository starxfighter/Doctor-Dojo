Doctor Dojo is a minimalistic electronic medical record that was designed to be used in a one physician medical office. The application has the basic functionality of 
•	Creating a patient
•	Creating a visit record
•	Collecting patient vitals and stats
•	Recording Allergies and Medication
•	Creating a S.O.A.P. note to be populated by the physician

The application has been built with Java/Spring Boot but also employs Spring Security and Bootstrap. The persistent data is being handled by MySQL.
